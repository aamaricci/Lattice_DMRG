# Lattice DMRG
*beta version*  

This is simple, yet complete, DMRG code to solve Heisenberg (spin-S) and Hubbard models, prevalently in 1d. The software exploits consevation of the Quantum Numbers ($S_z$ or $[N_\uparrow,N_\downarrow]$) to perform *infinite* and *finite* DMRG algorithms.  

 
The structure of this code is largely inspired by the simple-DMRG project: [GitHub](https://github.com/simple-dmrg/simple-dmrg) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1068359).

### Dependencies
The code is based on:

#### Milestone 5
- [x] Implement a better strategy for the SuperBlock matrix-vector product $H_{sb}|\psi\rangle$, exploiting the tensor product structure of $H_{sb}= H_L\otimes 1_R + 1_L\otimes H_R + H_{LR}$. 

With this update we introduce two distinct method to evaluate and diagonalize the SuperBlock (SB) Hamiltonian $H_{sb}$, according to 
the value of the parameter `sparse_H=T,F`.  
If `T` the matrix $H_{sb}$ is evaluated as a sparse matrix performing the kroenecker products above.  
If `F` each non-trivial part of the the matrix $H_{sb}$, i.e. $H_L$, $H_R$ and $H_{LR}$ are directly applied to the SB vector $|\psi\rangle$.To improve execution each term is decomposed into its  blocks structure corresponding to conserved quantum numbers $\vec{Q}=[Q_1,\dots,Q_N]$. In addition, exploiting the fact that each SB vector can be decomposed into a matrix form of Left and Right states, $|\psi\rangle = \sum_{lr} c_{lr} |l\rangle|r\rangle$, we can operate directly as follows:  
$[H_L\otimes 1_R] \circ |\psi\rangle \rightarrow H_L \circ \sum_l c_{lr}|l\rangle$  
$[1_L\otimes H_R] \circ |\psi\rangle \rightarrow H_R \circ \sum_r c_{lr}|r\rangle$   
and  
$H_{LR} \circ |\psi\rangle \rightarrow  \sum_p \sum_{Q_i} A_p(Q_i)\otimes B_p(Q_i) |\psi\rangle$  
where the matrices $A_p$, $B_p$ are the connecting operators (i.e. $c_{i\sigma}$ or $S_a(i)$) restricted between two blocks with quantum numbers $Q_i$ and $Q_j=Q_i-1_{\sigma/a}$.   


#### Milestone 6
- [ ] Implement parallel strategies. Different ideas can be followed:  
i) parallel execution of the tensor product for $H_{sb}$ for `sparse_H=T`, see [Large-Scale Implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm](https://iris.sissa.it/handle/20.500.11767/68070).  
ii) parallel execution of the little matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products for `sparse_H=F`. We can also profit of the matrix structure of the SB vector as done in massively parallel Exact Diagonalization algorithm, see  [EDIpack: A parallel exact diagonalization package for quantum impurity problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108261).   
iii) distributed storage of the vectors and sparse matrices. 




### Results
Here are some results for the Heisenberg model:  
$H = J_z \sum_{i} S_z(i)S_z(i+1) + J_{xy} \sum_{i,a=x,y} S_a(i)S_a(i+1)$

![plot](https://github.com/QcmPlab/Lattice_DMRG/blob/main/.plot/figs.png)

In the top panels we show the groundstate energy $E(j)$ and the entanglement entropy of the left block sites $S_L(j) = -{\mathrm Tr}[{\rho_L}\ln{\rho_L}]$ as a function the chain sites in a Spin 1/2 chain of 300 sites. The nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlation $\langle \vec{S}(j)\cdot \vec{S}(j+1)\rangle$ for the same system is reported in the bottom-left panel. Compare this result to the fig.6 of [Density-matrix algorithms for quantum renormalization groups](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.10345) (S.White, Phys. Rev. B 48, 10345).  
Finally, in the bottom-right panel we report the spatial distribution of the local magnetization for a Spin 1 chain with open boundary conditions, showing Spin 1/2 edge modes.

Results for the Hubbard model $H = -t\sum \sum_{i\sigma} c^\dagger_{i\sigma} c_{i+1\sigma} + 
U \sum_{i} n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow}$
are available here: 

![plot](https://github.com/QcmPlab/Lattice_DMRG/blob/main/.plot/figH.png)

For sake of simplicity we compare the energy per site of the non-interacting case $U=0$ at one electron per site $\langle N\rangle=1$ obtained from the two available Matrix-Vector methods (see above Milestone 5) against the exact Tight Binding and the exact solution $E_0 = -4t/\pi$. We used $M=100$ states which, as evident from the plot, are not enough to observe a decent convergence to the exact result but demonstrate the correct behavior of the DMRG algorithm. 


### Known issues
There are a number of known issues with this code which, mostly for time reasons, we did not solve completely. Please report to any of the authors.
